 In this project, we learn to focus on anomaly detection by using probability densities to detect credit card fraud.

## Project Summary
1. Developed a model to detect fraud cases in Credit Cards.
2. Used Isolation Forest(IF) and Local Outlier Factor(LOF) algorithms and achieved accuracy of 99.8 percent by removing outliers and errors.
